      <h3>Question 1: What is a data structure?</h3>
      <button class="show-answer">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
        <p>The answer is: A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.</p>

      <h3>Question 2: What is a graph, and how is it different from a tree?</h3>
      <button class="show-answer">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
        <p>Answer: A graph is a collection of nodes (or vertices) and edges that connect pairs of nodes. Unlike trees, graphs can have cycles, and nodes can be connected in various ways, allowing for more complex structures like social networks or transportation networks.</p>

      <h3>Question 3: What is a hash table, and how does it work? </h3>
      <button class="show-answer">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
        <p>Answer: A hash table is a data structure that maps keys to values using a hash function. The hash function computes an index into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. Hash tables provide efficient O(1) average time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion operations.</p>
