    <h2>Common Operating Systems Questions</h2>

      <h3>Question 1: What are the different states of a process in an operating system?</h3>
      <button class="show-answer">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
        <p>The answer is: The different states of a process include:<br>
New: The process is being created.<br>
Ready: The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor.<br>
Running: The process is being executed.<br>
Waiting: The process is waiting for some event to occur.<br>
Terminated: The process has finished execution.</p>

      <h3>Question 2: What is virtual memory, and why is it important?</h3>
      <button class="show-answer">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
        <p>The answer is:Virtual memory is a memory management technique that creates an illusion of a large (virtual) memory by using hardware and software to enable a computer to compensate for physical memory shortages. It allows the execution of processes that may not be completely in the physical RAM, thus enabling better multitasking and memory management.</p>

      <h3>Question 3: What is context switching in an operating system?</h3>
      <button class="show-answer">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
        <p>The answer is: Context switching is the process of storing the state of a currently running process or thread so that it can be resumed later and restoring the state of a different process or thread to start or resume its execution. This is essential for multitasking, allowing the CPU to switch between different processes or threads efficiently.</p>
