      <h3>Question 1: What is load flow analysis in power systems?</h3>
      <button class="show-answer">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
        <p>The answer is: Load flow analysis, also known as power flow analysis, is a computational method used to determine the steady-state operating conditions of a power system. It calculates the voltage magnitudes, phase angles, and power flows in the network under various loading conditions.</p>
