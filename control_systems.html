    <h2>Common Control Systems Interview Questions</h2>
    <section class="data-structure-question">
      <h3>Question 1: What is the main objective of a control system?</h3>
      <button class="show-answer">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
        <p>The answer is: The main objective of a control system is to regulate or manipulate the behavior of a dynamic system to achieve desired performance specifications.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="data-structure-question">
      <h3>Question 2: What is the Laplace transform used for in control systems?</h3>
      <button class="show-answer">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
        <p>The answer is: The Laplace transform is used to analyze and solve linear differential equations that describe the dynamic behavior of control systems in the frequency domain.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Question 3: What is the purpose of feedback in a control system?</h3>
      <button class="show-answer">Show Answer</button>
      <div class="answer" style="display: none;">
        <p>The answer is: The purpose of feedback in a control system is to compare the output with the reference input, allowing the system to adjust its behavior based on the error between the desired and actual outputs.</p>

A) To increase system bandwidth<br>
B) To reduce overshoot in the system<br>
C) To improve system stability<br>
D) To introduce phase lead in the system
</h3>
      <button class="show-answer">Show Answer</button>

      <h3>Question 5:What is the root locus plot used for in control systems?<br>
A) To analyze the transient response of the system<br>
B) To analyze the frequency response of the system<br>
C) To analyze the stability of the system<br>
D) To analyze the steady-state error of the system
